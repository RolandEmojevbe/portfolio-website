        <p>Without pre-existing insights into the market, I conducted an analysis of three competitor apps.</p>

      <h3>Early Insights</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6text">
          <p>Segmenting users by objectives, ie whether they were concerned only with learning new words rather than phrases, would help with driving the right kind of learning system to the apps.</p>
          <p>The apps that stood out were those that focused on competencies (eg ordering a coffee, introducing yourself etc) and sentence forming, rather than just words.</p>
          <p>Implementing a ‘build your programme’ feature would be very useful in understanding the current needs of users and their objectives. This would allow me to create a more targeted app.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6text">
          <p>If I were to create a learning app I would:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Incorporate the ‘build your programme’ feature in order to understand the users needs and incorporate onboarding as part of the learning process.</li>
            <li>Incorporate the use of pictures acting out the words/phrases being learned, to add another element of visual stimulation for the users and aid in achieving the apps end goal</li>
            <li>Include a visual timeline so user can see how they are progressing against their goal.</li>
          </ol>

      <h3>User Interviews</h3>

          <h4> Key Takeaways</h4>
          <p>From the user interviews, it was evident that users need a simple app that was more personalised and geared towards their holiday needs.</p>
          <p>Users also usually studied in 10-15 minute windows on language learning apps. This provided an upper limit for a typically lesson duration. </p>

        <h2>IDENTIFYING MY KEY USERS & THEIR GOALS</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>Armed with the research and data from the empathize stage, I was able to create a primary persona of the user that would have the most impact on the app.</p>
        <p>This allowed me to better understand the user’s needs, behaviours, and goals.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>I defined a list of user stories to allow me to focus on designing functions and solutions from Katherine’s perspective.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As an active girl, I want lessons to be broken down into 10-15-minute windows so that I can learn on the go.</li>
              <li>As I commute on the tube in London, I want to be able to download lessons so that I can learn offline and make my commute time more productive.</li>
              <li>As a globe trotter, I want to learn the basics of the language so that I can survive and feel confident asking for help along the way.</li>
              <li>As a solo traveller, I want to be able to improve my pronunciation and practise speaking the new language so that I can communicate well with the locals.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>I also defined a list of job stories to provide the context in which Katherine’s users stories might take place.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When I am travelling the world alone, I want to know the basics of the local language so that I can feel safe in my surroundings and ask for help should I need it.</li>
              <li>When I am commuting to work, I want to be able to use an app to learn a new language so that I can make my commute more productive.</li>
              <li>When I am learning a new language, I want to be visually stimulated so that I feel more engaged in the process rather than just reading plain text.</li>
              <li>When I am learning a new language, I want to be able to track my progress towards a specified end date so that I can ensure I am ready ahead of my holiday.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>From the deeper insights (developed building the primary persona and stories) I defined a problem statement to help focus the project on Katherine’s need and hypothesise a solution.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <h3>Problem statement</h3>
            <p>Katherine needs a way to learn the basics of a new language on the go because she has a very busy work and social schedule and enjoys travelling the world solo. She needs to feel visually stimulated and be able to improve her verbal
              communication of the language so that she is able to ask for help should she need it.</p>
            <p>We will know this to be true when we see that Katherine is able to practise speaking the new language within the app and study in short interval windows.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>We believe that by creating a visually oriented interface and lessons which are broken down into 10-15-miunte windows, that can also be downloaded for offline use for Katherine, we will achieve a way for Katherine’s basic knowledge of
              new languages to improve whilst juggling a busy work and social calendar.</p>

        <p>I utilised task analysis and created user flows in order to define the information architecture of the app.</p>
        <p>Through task analysis, I identified the common steps that would be required to perform and complete specific tasks within the app. I then built user flows to visualise exactly the path my users would take.</p>

              <p>Solution: I included an additional screen summarising the findings and how the programme had been adapted as a result.</p>

        <h2>Project Retrospective</h2>
        <p>Overall, I had a lot of fun creating HoliPrep and it’s been nice looking back at the journey - starting from a blank sheet to a clickable prototype.</p>

          <div class="column retro">
            <h4>What went well?</h4>
            <p>I was able to understand the importance of UX research and in ensuring all decisions were based on findings or had a strong, valid reason for not listening to the data</p>
            <p>
              <span-bold>Skills:</span-bold> UX research, User testing, Iterative design.

            <h4>What didn’t go well?</h4>
            <p>I was unable to design all the features I wanted to include in the app. However, this means I had to prioritise the most important features for the MVP.</p>

              <span-bold>Solution:</span-bold> Prioritise MVP elements at the start of the project and build a timetable that centres around the MVP.

            <p>A lot of time was spent deciding UI elements of the design and creating elements that perfectly emulated Holiprep.</p>

        <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>It’s impossible to create the perfect solution on the first attempt and the power of iterative prototyping and usability testing in the design thinking process should not be underestimated.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>Getting down ideas in low-fidelity wireframes was a very useful and simple way to test the logic and flows of the design. Even just by creating the initial draft of the prototype on paper, I immediately started to notice elements I had
              missed or not given much thought.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>Testing with the target audience took the designs a step further and it was interesting to see that some of my views and logic (that I thought were crystal clear) weren’t always the case for my users.</p>
