        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>To round of the eight months of the UX design introduction and immersion courses at Career Foundry, I spent the next two months diving into the world of frontend development, learning how to code this very portfolio website.</p>
            <p>As a novice, with absolutely not prior frontend development experience, it has been a very steep learning curve. I am oh so proud of making it out the other side.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>This case study looks at my process, from writing my very first line of code to pushing my own polished HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to a web host - so the finished responsive portfolio website you see today can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6text">
          <p>Being a naturally curious person, I jumped at the opportunity to level up my skills as a designer and learn to code a website. By understanding the building blocks that make a website, I will recommend and build ideas based on feasible solutions, taking into consideration potential boundaries, all the while having smoother and faster hand-offs with developers.</p>

        <h2>Process and Insights</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>With my UX hat on I started where all well trained designers would: Scoping out the market space and researching the various types of portfolio websites for inspiration, common themes, and areas I could try to improve on.</p>
        <p>I then decided to carry the tone, personality and branding style from my CV and emulated this in a prototype I created using Figma. This would keep a consistent theme across my professional brand.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Next I deep dived into all things HTML, CSS and JavaScript putting the learnings into practise by writing the code for my website in Atom. Using pain point display sizes in the CSS styling to ensure a responsive display across different devices.</p>
        <p>I then tested with four participants and used cross-browser testing. I’ve implemented the critical findings and quick wins and will continue to iterate on my website in true design thinking style.</p>

        <p>Finally I used several code linters (including w3C validation) to ensure the quality of my HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.</p>

        <p>I utilised task analysis and created user flows in order to define the information architecture of the app.</p>
        <p>Through task analysis, I identified the common steps that would be required to perform and complete specific tasks within the app. I then built user flows to visualise exactly the path my users would take.</p>

        <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>It’s impossible to create the perfect solution on the first attempt and the power of iterative prototyping and usability testing in the design thinking process should not be underestimated.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>Getting down ideas in low-fidelity wireframes was a very useful and simple way to test the logic and flows of the design. Even just by creating the initial draft of the prototype on paper, I immediately started to notice elements I had
              missed or not given much thought.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6text">
            <p>Testing with the target audience took the designs a step further and it was interesting to see that some of my views and logic (that I thought were crystal clear) weren’t always the case for my users.</p>
