        <p>I utilised the Design Thinking Process as it allowed me to better understand and define the problem space. This was essential in order to discover and design an innovative solution that fulfilled users’ needs.</p>

            <p>Londoners want a social way to take gaming outside and enjoy playing with friends.</p>
            <p>Building scavenger hunts are time consuming and difficult to tailor to your location.</p>
            <p>Current scavenger hunt apps are costly and focused on finding physical items, rather than location based, meaning Londoners find it hard to sightsee for free.</p>

            <p>We will know this to be true when we see that users are able to partake in local scavenger hunts with their friends and tailor the hunt stops and locations to their needs.</p>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>To further my understanding of the users I was designing for, I conducted three user interviews. These participants, aged between 21 and 30, represented my key target user demographic.</p>
        <div class="row">

            Users welcomed the idea very strongly and loved the concept. Generally, users do not know much about their local city and are always looking for interesting ways to spend more time outdoors.

            Marketing the app as a social competitive scavenger hunt and fun day out, answering easy fun riddles, rather than historical learning expedition, would be better received from my users.

          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>In order to put a human face to my research and narrative, and to ensure design decisions were always focused on the users, I created three User Personas, representing the majority of my target audience.</p>

        <p>Through task analysis, I created user flows to keep the designs more user-centred.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>With all my research and initial structure in place. I was now able to start wireframing and prototyping key features - bringing my design ideas to life.</p>
        <h3>Low-fidelity prototypes</h3>
        <p>I started with good old reliable pen and paper to quickly sketch the initial screens, highlighting only the high-level functionality of my designs.</p>

        <h3>Usability Test</h3>
        <p>Before moving on to the high-fidelity prototyping, I first conducted usability testing to ensure the core elements and functionality met users’ needs. Six moderated in-person tests held at participants’ homes. Participants aged 18-35.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>The overarching goal was to assess the usability of the app, focusing on how easily users were able to complete tasks and navigate within the prototype.</p>
            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>Test included a short briefing and task performance on the Search Party prototype - a combination of direct and scenario tasks were used.</p>
          </div>

            <h4>Test objectivies</h4>

              <p></p>

            <p>I then used a rainbow spreadsheet to document severity and frequency of errors, coupled with possible solutions and the next steps I would take.</p>

            <p>During the testing phase, I also conducted a preference test on two variations of the hunt browse screen. The test focused on what method users preferred for communicating the hunt difficulty level.</p>
            <p>13 participants took part in the preference test with 85% preferring option B. Main reasons centred on option B looking more fun, vibrant and like a party compared to Option A.</p>
            <p>Some comments were raised around the busyness of option B, but given the purpose of the app (fun, vibrant, social game) I believe that if users were provided with more context, and the opportunity to test the whole prototype, this comment would not have been raised.</p>

                <h2>Style Guide and Design System</h2>
                <p>Through the style guide I created for Search Party, I was able to naturally gain more knowledge and understanding of the product, acting as a foundation for the design language.</p>
                <p>I developed the design language system as a set of overarching rules and standards to maintain the app’s consistency across multiple platforms and devices.</p>

            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <h3>Ideate - Prototype – Test</h3>
            <p>In true design thinking style,  I conducted further usability testing, this time in the form of a peer review, on the updated prototype.</p>
            <p>I received very useful feedback, highlighting further improvement that could be made, which have now been implemented.</p>
            <h3>What next</h3>
            <p>I will continue to conduct usability tests as additional elements, screens and features are added to the product.</p>
